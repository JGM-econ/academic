I am a Teaching Assistant in Macroeconomics (Graduate) and Finance (Undergraduate) for the Department of Economics and the Sa√Ød Business School at University of Oxford. During my classes, I have had the opportunity to deeply engage with students and contribute to their academic and personal development. My commitment to teaching is centered around inclusiveness, a dual approach combining mathematical rigor and intuitive understanding, and providing students with additional resources and career guidance. My teaching has been distinguished by a teaching award.
